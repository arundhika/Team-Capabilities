LLM Evaluation Metrics
📌 Quick Summary
LLM Evaluation Metrics is a comprehensive framework for assessing the quality, reliability, and effectiveness of Large Language Model responses. This CLI-based wrapper tool provides 20+ metrics to measure aspects like relevance, faithfulness, completeness, toxicity, and consistency across diverse queries and contexts. It enables teams to systematically evaluate and improve LLM performance through data-driven analysis.

🎯 What is LLM Evaluation?
LLM Evaluation is the systematic process of measuring and assessing how well language models perform on specific tasks. Instead of relying on subjective impressions, evaluation metrics provide quantifiable data about model behavior across multiple dimensions:

Quality Assessment - How good is the response?
Reliability Measurement - How consistent and trustworthy is the model?
Factual Accuracy - Does the response align with ground truth?
Safety & Ethics - Does the response contain harmful content?
User Satisfaction - Will users find the response helpful?
