Agentic AI
üìå Quick Summary
Agentic AI refers to autonomous artificial intelligence systems designed to operate independently and make decisions without constant human intervention. These agents perceive their environment, reason about information, and take actions to achieve specific goals through a continuous loop of observation, analysis, and execution.

üéØ What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence where systems move beyond reactive responses to become proactive decision-makers. Unlike traditional AI models that respond to specific prompts, agentic AI systems:

Operate autonomously with minimal human oversight
Make independent decisions based on their understanding of context and goals
Learn from interactions to improve performance over time
Adapt to changing environments without reprogramming
Execute multi-step tasks without human intervention at each step
